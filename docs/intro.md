## Introduction

CircleChain app is blockchain based application. Its token is circle coin, the unit of <i>cc</i> is <i>li</i>, 1<i>cc</i> = 100,000<i>li</i>.

When a new block is mined, the coin base for miner is 10<i>cc</i>(1,000,000<i>li</i>). Not only circle coin is mined out, there are two other assets mined out: identity and ownership. So there are the three types of assets in new 

* circle coin
* ownership uid
* idenity uid

## What's the difference?

The circle coin is just the coin token used to exchange for virtual assets including ownership, identity, authority of usage etc. All the virtual assets will be exchanged by circle coin.

The blockchain assets includes ownership and identity. The ownership is the certificate to own some virtual asset in the blockchain. The ownership is the certificate to show your idenity in the blockchain.

The ownership can be transfered from one address to the other address with some coin fees(10<i>li</i>). When one ownership is transfered, the new ownership uid will be generated to the transferer. The transfer and recevier are not contrained except for the same address. So you can use your own two different addresses: one for the transfer, the other for the receiver, with some transfer coin fees, you can 'buy' some ownership assets for you.

The identity can also be transfered from one address to the other address with some coin fees(10<i>li</i>). When one identity is transfered, the new identity uid will be generated to the transfer. The transfer and receiver are not constrained exception for the same address. So you can use your own two different addresses: one for the transfer, the other for the receiver, with some transfer coin fees, you can 'buy' some identity assets for you.
